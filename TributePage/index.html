                <ul id="tribute-info">
                    <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, commonly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was an eminent Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he emerged as a prominent figure known for his contributions to India's space and missile development programs.

                      Kalam began his career as a scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he played a pivotal role in the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle and various missiles. He was particularly instrumental in the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Agni and Prithvi missiles.
                      
                      Apart from his scientific pursuits, Kalam was a visionary leader who emphasized the importance of education and youth empowerment. He believed in harnessing the potential of India's youth for national development and prosperity. He often interacted with students and encouraged them to pursue careers in science and technology.
                      
                      Kalam's presidency was marked by his dedication to promoting education, scientific research, and societal development. He was widely respected for his humility, integrity, and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the nation.
                      
                      After his presidency, Kalam continued to be actively involved in various educational and societal initiatives. He authored several books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," which inspired millions of people, especially the youth, to strive for excellence and innovation.
                      
                      A.P.J. Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. He left behind a legacy of scientific achievement, patriotism, and a vision for a developed and empowered India.
